AutoHotKey-Scripts
==================

A collection of useful AutoHotKey scripts. AutoHotKey is a powerful scripting langage for Windows. Download it here first to run these AHK files: http://www.autohotkey.com/download. You can compile these into executables to be used anywhere without installing AutoHotKey (eg via a thumbdrive). There's tons of good scripts out there but these are some I use every day. You can combine them into one .ahk file to have them all run at once.

## ColorCursor ##

A colour picker for whatever is under the mouse pointer on the screen. Gets the hexadecimal colour code and saves it to the clipboard. Very useful for web design. 

Press 'Win + C' keyboard shortcut to bring up the colour label that follows your mouse pointer around. Click the 'Esc' key to copy the hex colour to the clipboard and hide the label.

## VirtualDesktop ##

Adds an extra desktop to your screen. Switch between desktops by using 'Win + Left/Right Arrow' keys (right to view desktop 2, left to return to desktop 1). Or you can click the number that appears in the top left-hand corner of the screen to switch desktops. 

Move the current focused window to the other desktop by the shortcut 'Win + Down Arrow'. 

Quit VirtualDesktop by the shortcut 'Win + 0'. All of your windows are moved back to your main desktop.

## SkeletonHTML ##

A macro for automatically creating a blank HTML document. Saves a lot of time if you create new HTML documents often. Run it in the background, open a new text document and type 'skel' then hit 'Enter' and it prefills the document with <html> <head> etc. Try it.
